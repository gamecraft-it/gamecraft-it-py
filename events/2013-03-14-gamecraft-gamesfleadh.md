On Thursday 14th March many game developers from all over the country will gather together in [Games Fleadh](http://www.gamesfleadh.ie/),  to pour forth their creative juices in an extravaganza of game development talent that hasn’t been seen since…well, since the first Dublin GameCraft in November. That’s right, it’s time for another GameCraft . This time around, particpants, either individually or as a team, have a 7 hours to create a game centered around a random theme to be announced on the day.  It will be exciting, it will be intense, it will be…slightly pungent, frankly. But it will be worth it! After 7 hours, a panel of highly trained judges (at least, they look highly trained) will examine each of the submitted games and select a few stand out entries to be awarded some awesome prizes. While the games are being pinched, prodded, and poked, we’ll all have some  time for the all important networking. Participants are free to use whatever game creation platform they like, be that Unity, UDK, GameMaker, Construct2, XNA, or one of the myriad other fine platforms available today. Good luck and may the most ridiculous game win!
