* You have twelve hours to make a game. Starting at 9am
* The theme will be advertised during breakfast (more details on this soon)
* Work on your own or with a team. You can form a team on the day if you like, but remember you only have 12 hours!
* Use whatever platform or framework you like
* Judges review and vote on the games
* Profit  Prizes(will update soon).
