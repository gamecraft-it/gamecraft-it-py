We can't believe it has been just little over two years since our first Dublin GameCraft, and thanks to everyone for the support and help us keeping it going.

We started Dublin GameCraft at [DIT](http://dit.ie) and we thought, why not celebrate its second anniversary back at our good friends at [DIT](http://dit.ie).

So, that's a bit of a heads up. This post will be updated with more details on what is happening that day, where to register.
