Dublin GameCraft is a game jam style event to be held in DIT, Kevin Street, Ireland on the 25th of February and it’s kicking off at 9am – good job there’s a free breakfast provided then! Oh and free lunch too, this is like the best jam ever, no?

Anyway, enough of the food (whimper), the Dublin Gamecraft is an 8 hour game jam – yes just 8 hours to make a game – and it’s open to anyone who can attend. Development teams can be pre-determined or decided on the day (although the latter will eat into development time). There’s even a little Google group for people to meet up and make teams. You’ll be pleased to hear that you can use whatever game building tools you like (Unity/GameMaker/UDK etc), and target whatever platform you’re most familiar with (Windows/iPad/Xbox).
