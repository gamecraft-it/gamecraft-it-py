<h3>Dave McCabe</h3>
<p>Dave McCabe is a filmmaker, video game narrative designer and all around writer sort who has worked on more things than he’d care to remember. He’d give you a list, but it would just depress him when you’d heard of none of it. He has been playing video games since he couldn’t get past the first boss of an early 80′s version of ‘Green Beret’ that is so old he can’t even find a video for it on youtube. You can find him on twitter <a href="http://dublingamecraft.com/category/judges-2/twitter.com/davetheallthing">@davetheallthing</a> where he’ll probably say something about your ma.</p>

<p>Paul has been playing games since 1980, which is terrifyingly long ago.<br />
Originally from a video and sound background, Paul has in the past been involved in the production of shows for NEAR FM and East Coast Radio and numerous video productions.</p>
<p>His main interests are narrative and its use in games and the computer game as a creative and artistic medium.</p>
