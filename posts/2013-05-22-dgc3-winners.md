**[Update]: Sorry to the guys from Adventure Boat, they were not in this list originally :(**

So there we go. Another Saturday, another wildly successful Dublin GameCraft. Thanks again to everyone who took part. GameCraft would be nothing without you! It was generally agreed that the quality of the games took a massive leap forwards this time, and we can only hope that this is a reflection on the explosive growth we’re seeing in our little Irish games industry. Perhaps lamentably, the real world demands that only the best games receive the prizes, but dammit, each and every one of you have our respect…except maybe the actual winners. It’s probably not fair that you get two prizes;)

So without further rambling, here are the winners:

## For Most Valuable Game, Blood Bankers.
