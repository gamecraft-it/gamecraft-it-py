We’ll start the live streaming at 9am. Meanwhile you can donate by clicking [here](http://www.mycharity.ie/event/charitygamecraft) It will take you to mycharity.ie where you can choose how much to donate.

I know you all want to know the theme… thanks to Dave McCabe, GameCraft’s resident MC for coming up with one.

### Drumroll…. the theme is: Envision Christmas in the year 2525
