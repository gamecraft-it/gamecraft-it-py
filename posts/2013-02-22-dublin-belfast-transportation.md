This is announcement to those who are travelling to Belfast for GameCraft this evening. As you are aware, the arrangement for the hired coach up has fallen through. It’s too late to hire another one that’s available so last minute and affordable.

So here is a list of cross-border buses that are the cheaper alternative.

* [Bus Eireann](http://journeyplanner.buseireann.ie/jp/bin/query.exe/en?ld=std&currentCSS=theme_be&seqnr=3&ident=lu.0382062.1361537546&REQ0HafasScrollDir=1) (best option as they have regular buses to Belfast throughout the night)

	“These tickets can be purchased from the local Bus Station or from the Bus Driver.”

* Air Coach – [http://www.aircoach.ie/table.routes.belfast.php](http://www.aircoach.ie/table.routes.belfast.php)
*  Translink GoldLink - [http://www.translink.co.uk/Services/Goldline/](http://www.translink.co.uk/Services/Goldline/)

Andrea has offered to pick up people when they get to Belfast, if others who are driving, if you can help out, that would be great.

Apologies to those who booked a place for the bus us, please pass the word on to others as we don’t have the list of the people who registered.
