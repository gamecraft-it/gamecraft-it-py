Hey GameCrafters!

The 23rd is getting closer! The big deal for people coming from Dublin is transport. [Shane Kavanagh](https://www.facebook.com/shaneshanekavanagh?fref=ts) has done all the hard work trying to organise a bus to take us directly to the venue from Dublin and back again. All on the same day.

The cost per person depends on the numbers using the bus. We’ll need at least 14 people for it to make sense, but the more we get, the cheaper it’ll be.

If we get enough people, we’ll be GameCrafting in Belfast for the day, without the hassle of public transport! Nice.

PS Thanks to Shane for the hard work!
