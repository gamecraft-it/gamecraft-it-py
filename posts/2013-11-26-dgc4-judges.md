<p><strong>Declan Doody</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been playing games since I was four years old and giving out about them since I was five! I am Editor for theArcade.ie and I&#8217;ve been writing critically about video games for the past four years and organising one of the largest gatherings of gamers and geeks in the country, ArcadeCon, for the last three.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Colm Larkin</strong></p>
<p>Colm has been making games since his family got their first computer when he was 6 years old (a ZX Spectrum 128). Nowadays he&#8217;s a software engineer for Swrve by day and a hobbyist game developer by night. Since co-founding the Dublin One Game A Month group this year he&#8217;s finished a number of small games and is now working on his first commercial game &#8216;Guild of Dungeoneering&#8217;.</p>
