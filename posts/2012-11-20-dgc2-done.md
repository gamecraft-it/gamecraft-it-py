It might have started a bit later than intended at 09:30, but we wrapped up in time with the breaking out of the beer to celebrate a fantastic day. The day was full of excitement, ideas, lots of sugary drinks and coffee (although I did notice fresh fruit sustenance).

After tools were downed, and stickers were distributed for those to vote for their People’s Choice awards (gold star stickers for judges), and everybody got a chance to play the games after 12 hours of blood, sweat and tears.
