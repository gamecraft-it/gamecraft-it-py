<p>Hi</p>
<p>Posting live from Telford, at Insomnia GameCraft. The theme for today is &#8220;Last assignment&#8221; and we are in full swing here.<br />
For some background info, Insomnia is a gaming conference, it&#8217;s basically a huge LAN party with tournaments, an exhibition hall including a generous section for indies such as <a href="http://snozbot.com/" target="_blank">Snozbot</a>, <a href="http://digitalfurnacegames.com/" target="_blank">Honourboud</a>, <a href="http://dreamthegame.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dream</a>, and many more, check <a href="http://insomniagamingfestival.com/indie-zone/" target="_blank">here</a>. There is also some other more established games on display such as  XCOM enemy within, XBOne with Forza and Need for speed and many hardware providers.</p>
